# Chapter 1 - Digital Systems and Informations

## Analog and Digital Signals

Analog and digital signals are two types of signals carrying information.

Analog signals are continuous in both values and time, while digital signals are discrete in value and time.

## Digital System

Takes a set of discrete information inputs and discrete internal information (system state) and generates a set of discrete information outputs.

## Analog-To-Digital (ADC) Converters

ADC converts a signal from analog (continuous) to digital (discrete) form. It provides a link between the analog world of transducers and the digital world of signal processing.

The result of ADC comprises a string of bytes, e.g., 010, 110, 100, 001.
