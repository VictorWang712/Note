# Welcome Lecture - Introduction to Oxford University

- Speaker: Prof. Martin Bureau - Department of Physics (Astrophysics) and Wadham College

A distinctive feature of *teaching* at Oxford is the personalised approach, where professors teach students in a one-on-one or one-on-two format.

The University of Cambridge was established in 1209 following a separation from Oxford.

Oxford is a *collegiate* university, comprising 40 self-governing colleges, which has been instrumental in its longevity.

The most accessible subject for admission to Oxford is Classics, which includes the study of ancient Greek and Roman civilisations.

The most challenging subject for admission is Philosophy, Politics, and Economics (PPE).

A unique aspect of *studying* at Oxford is the Tutorial System.
