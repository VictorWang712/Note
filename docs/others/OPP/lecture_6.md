# Lecture 6 - Multicomponent High-Entropy Cantor Alloys

- Speaker: Prof. Brian Cantor - Department of Materials

Human history is deeply intertwined with the discovery and development of new materials.

All materials are alloys.

There are countless materials.

Multicomponent alloys are essential to our future well-being and sustainability.

## Human Development and New Materials

- Stone Age: Flint tools
- Agricultural Revolution: Clay bricks and pots
- Bronze Age: Cu-Sn alloys
- Iron age: Fe-C alloys
- Industrial Revolution: Steels
- Information Revolution: Silicon chips

## Alloying Stratrgies

- Conventional alloying strategy: One major component for main properties and small-scale alloying additions for secondary properties.
- Multicomponent alloying strategy: A large number of components in equal or near-equal proportions.

## Multicomponent Solution Thermodynamics

The structure of a material depends on the free energy of mixing the different components $G$, which itself depends on the chemical interactions $H$ and the entropy $S$:

$$G = \sum (x_{i}\mu_{i}) + \Delta G_{\text{mix}}$$

$$\Delta G_{\text{mix}} = \Delta H_{\text{mix}} - T \Delta S_{\text{mix}}$$

## Multicomponent Meterial Counting

Consider a system with $C$ components, where each component can vary in composition.

Let different materials be distinct if they differ by $x\%$, i.e., there are $n = \frac{100}{x}$ composition values for each component.

The total number of distinct alloys or materials $N$ is given by the law of combinations with repetition:

$$N = \binom{C + n - 1}{n} = \frac{(C + n - 1)!}{(C - 1)! n!}$$

Conservatively, let $C = 60$ and $x = 0.1\%$, so that:

$$N = \frac{1059!}{59! \cdot 1000!} \approx 10^{100}$$

For comparison, there are approximately $10^{66}$ atoms in the galaxy, $10^{80}$ atoms in the observable universe, and the size of the universe is roughly $10^{34} \text{nm}$.

The number of known materials is approximately $10^{12}$, a tiny fraction of the total possible materials.

There are nearly 20 trillion local clusters in a 5-component material and 600 trillion in a 6-component material.

## Key Issues of Nanoscale Multicomponent Sturcture

- Disorder and entropy
- Heat of mixing
- Nanostructure
- Short range order
- Lattice strain
- Vacancies and diffusion
- Dislocations and slip
- Twinning and fracture
- Radiation damage
- Recycling

## Properties and Uses of Multicomponent High-Entropy Alloys

- Cryogenic and high temperature strength
- Corrosion and radiation damage resistance
- Tunable functional properties
- Recycling and re-use

## Conclusions

Human history is deeply intertwined with the discovery and development of new materials.

All materials are alloys.

There are countless materials.

There are countless new materials waiting to be discovered.

Generic alloys are essential for efficient recycling and sustainability.
