## British Etiquette

Understanding *why* etiquette matters is crucial, as it facilitates integration into the host culture.

Mind your Ps and Qs (*Please* and *Thank you*).

It is impossible to *apologise* excessively!

> "That's not bad" means "That's really good"
>
> "I hear what you say" means "I disagree with you"
>
> "I'm sure it's my fault, but" means "It's your fault"

**Situations Warranting an Apology**

- Walking into someone
- Being early or late
- Coughing or sneezing
- Asking someone for help

Dos: Maintain appropriate body language, establish eye contact, respect personal space, adhere to the dress code, and engage in small talk.

Don'ts: Avoid cancelling at the last minute, attending without an invitation, or queue-jumping.

Formal introductions typically involve a firm handshake, sustained eye contact, and a confident demeanour.

When introducing yourself, state your name and use an appropriate title (e.g., Prof., Miss, Mr.) if applicable.

Informal introductions may involve a brief hug or a cheek kiss.

Dining etiquette includes eating quietly, avoiding slurping, keeping your mouth closed while chewing, refraining from placing elbows on the table, maintaining proper posture, placing the napkin on your lap, and sipping during toasts.

**Afternoon tea**

Originating in the 1840s, afternoon tea was popularised by Anna, Duchess of Bedford.
