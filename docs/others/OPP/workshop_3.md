*What Makes a Great Horror Film?*

## Storytelling through Film

### Horror Sub-genres

## Sound and Cinematography

### Sound Design and Storytelling

**Diegetic**:

- Door Slam
- Floorboards Creak
- Wind Howls
- Music from a Radio

**Non-Diegetic**:

- Film Score
- Voiceover/Narration
- Sound Design Effects (e.g., a violin strike for a jump-scare)

Listen to the track:

- Consider the types of sound present, for example, organic vs. inorganic
- What kind of atmosphere does the sound create?

### Shot Sizes

- Wide Shot
- Close-up
- Medium Shot
- Wide Shot - High Angle
- Close-up - Low Angle
- Medium Shot - Low Angle
- Two-shot
- POV
- Over the Shoulder
- Cutaway
- Through Foreground
- Following

### Rule of Thirds

The man's head is positioned at an intersection between two lines, known as a **hotspot**.

The treetops in the background align roughly with the lower horizontal third line.

The sun is positioned at the top right hotspot. Its reflection is located at the bottom right hotspot.

The sky occupies roughly one third, the sea one third, and the beach one third.

The sun and the butterfly are positioned near the hotspot.

The sea occupies two thirds, while the sky occupies one third.

Consider the amount of space occupied and the angle of the shot.

### Linear Camera Movement

- Dolly Across
- Dolly In
- Track Backward
- Pedesral Up
- Dolly Out
- Track Forward

### Single Light Positions

- Rembrandt
- Monster
- Silhouette

### Lighting Examples

- Sunrise & Sunset
- Night, Using street lights
- Night, Using lamplight
- Even Lighting
- Lighting from Below
- Dramatic Lighting

## Shooting a Scene

### Colour and Emotion

### Coverage

- Wide Shot
- Mid Shots of Each Character
- Close-ups of Each Character
- Cutaways

Start far away and gradually move closer.

### The 180 Degree Rule

The camera should remain on one side of an imaginary axis between two characters, ensuring that the first character is always frame right of the second character. Moving the camera over the axis is referred to as *jumping the line* or *crossing the line*; breaking the 180-degree rule by shooting on all sides is known as *shooting in the round*.

The 180-degree rule allows the viewer to visually connect with unseen movement occurring around and behind the immediate subject and is particularly crucial in the narration of battle scenes.
