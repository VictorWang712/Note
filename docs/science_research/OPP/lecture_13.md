## The Significance of Black Holes in Astrophysics

### Hierarchical Structure Formation in the Universe

The formation of galaxies involves the following processes:

- The universe expands. Overdense regions collapse, leading to the growth and merging of structures.
- Dark matter dominates the gravitational dynamics. Gas accretes and accumulates, leading to the formation and evolution of stars and galaxies.
- Runaway star formation occurs, yet large blue galaxies (and green ones) are not observed.
- Black holes regulate gas accretion and, through feedback mechanisms, self-limit star formation.
- Black holes and galaxies co-evolve, preventing the formation of large blue galaxies.

### The $M_{\text{BH}}-\sigma_{\text{star}}$ Relation: Current Status

Supermassive black hole (SMBH) masses:

- These masses underpin a vast theoretical framework and all indirect measurement methods. However, only a limited number of measurements (approximately 100, all local) exist.
- A limited number of methods are available, each subject to unique selection effects and systematic biases.
- The sample is highly biased.

Elliptical galaxies: Stellar kinematics are used to estimate SMBH masses.

Spiral galaxies: Ionised gas kinematics are employed for mass estimation.

Seyfert II galaxies: Maser kinematics provide mass measurements.

- There is a pressing need for a universal method applicable to all galaxy types, conceptually straightforward (free from systematics), and easily scalable for rapid application.

## Light Properties and Telescope Techniques

Light, as an electromagnetic wave, exhibits the following properties:

- Intensity: Imaging
- Wavelength: Spectroscopy
- Polarisation: Polarimetry

### Spectroscopic Techniques

Spectral lines (emission or absorption) provide information on:

- Chemical composition
- Physical state
- Kinematics (via the Doppler effect): $\frac{\Delta v}{c} = \frac{\Delta \lambda}{\lambda}$ (non-relativistic approximation)

### Spatial Resolution

Limitations in optical resolution include:

- Diffraction limit: $\theta \approx \frac{\lambda}{D}$, where $\theta$ is the angular resolution, $\lambda$ is the wavelength, and $D$ is the telescope diameter.

Resolution is proportional to the telescope diameter and inversely proportional to the wavelength.

- prop. telescope diametre
- inv. prop. wavelength

- Natural seeing conditions typically result in an angular resolution of $\theta \approx 1''$ in the optical regime.

Techniques to improve resolution include:

- Speckle imaging
- Adaptive optics (using laser guide stars or natural stars)
- Interferometry

### Synthesis Imaging Techniques

Key principles of synthesis imaging include:

- A baseline is formed between two antennas.
- The number of baselines is given by $= \frac{N(N - 1)}{2}$, where $N$ is the number of antennas.
- The *u-v* plane represents the spatial frequency domain.
- The image is obtained as the Fourier transform of the (sparsely populated) *u-v* plane.
- The synthesized beam and resulting image are produced.

Spatial frequency filtering involves:

- The maximum baseline determines the highest resolution (smallest detectable structures).
- The minimum baseline determines the lowest resolution (largest detectable structures).

## The Black Hole at the Centre of the Milky Way

### Measuring the Mass of the Central Black Hole

The measurement is based on the following principles:

- $F = ma$
- $\frac{GMm}{R^{2}} = \frac{mv^{2}}{R}$
- $M \propto v^{2}R$
- $v \propto \frac{M^{\frac{1}{2}}}{R^{\frac{1}{2}}}$

### Stellar Orbits in the Milky Way

The analysis is based on the following principles:

$F = ma = m \frac{\text{d}v}{\text{d}t} = m \frac{\text{d}^{2}x}{\text{d}t^{2}}$

However, the underlying cause of the stars' orbital motion remains a key question.

## Observing Black Holes with ALMA

### The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)

- A collaboration between Europe, North America, and East Asia, hosted in Chile.
- A $1.5 billion investment.
- Now fully operational.
- Comprising 50 antennas of 12 metres and 12 antennas of 7 metres.
- Multiple large arrays for enhanced resolution.
- Capable of observing across a wide range of frequencies.
- Located at an exceptional site with minimal atmospheric interference.

### Measuring Dark Mass with ALMA

The measurement is based on the following principles:

$\frac{GM_{R}}{R^{2}} = \frac{v^{2}}{R}$, where $M_{R}$ is the enclosed mass at radius $R$, and $v$ is the orbital velocity.

Define the Schwarzschild radius as $R_{\text{Schw}} \equiv \frac{2GM_{\text{BH}}}{c^{2}}$

This yields $\left( \frac{v}{c} \right)^{2} = \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{R}{R_{\text{Schw}}} \right)^{-1} \frac{M_{R}}{M_{\text{BH}}}$

For $M_{R} \approx M_{\text{BH}}$, this simplifies to $\left( \frac{v}{c} \right)^{2} \approx \frac{1}{2} \left( \frac{R}{R_{\text{Schw}}} \right)^{-1}$
