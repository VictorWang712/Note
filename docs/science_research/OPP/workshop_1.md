**Exercise 1**

**Introduction Slide**:

- **Title**: "A Taste of Two Cultures: Food in the UK and China"
- **Visuals**: Side-by-side images of iconic dishes (e.g., fish and chips vs. dumplings or stir-fry).
- **Brief Overview**: Highlight the diversity and richness of both cuisines, emphasizing how history, geography, and culture shape their food traditions.
- **Purpose**: To examine the differences in staple foods, flavour profiles, and cooking techniques between the UK and China.

**3 Topics**:

1. **Staple Foods**: Compare the role of potatoes, bread, and meat in the UK versus rice, noodles, and wheat-based foods in China.
2. **Flavour Profiles**: Contrast the mild, savoury flavours of British cuisine with the bold, diverse flavours of Chinese cuisine.
3. **Cooking Methods**: Discuss the UK’s focus on roasting, baking, and frying versus China’s emphasis on stir-frying, steaming, and braising.

**Take-Home Message**:

- **Key Insight**: While the UK and China have vastly different food cultures, both reflect their unique histories, geographies, and traditions. Understanding these differences enriches our appreciation of global culinary diversity.
- **Final Thought**: Food is more than sustenance—it’s a window into the heart of a culture.

## Aesthetics

Avoid stacking image elements with similar colour values.

It is advisable to utilise your *institutional template*.

Pay attention to the differences in slide appearance between laptop screens and projectors.

Generally, black text on a white background is preferable to white text on a black background. Additionally, a white background is more compatible with images (e.g., institutional logos) and other elements.

## Creating Content

Adopt a guiding approach to effectively instruct your audience.

## Delivery Techniques

- Open body language
- Pacing: Maintain a moderate speed; avoid being too fast or too slow.
- Avoid reading directly from the slides.
- Make eye contact.

**Exercise 4**

**The Biological Basis of Soul Mates – A Revolutionary Discovery**

Imagine a world where love isn’t just a mystery—it’s a science. We have uncovered groundbreaking biological markers that indicate compatibility at the deepest level, offering a data-driven approach to finding true soul mates. Our research suggests that specific genetic and neurological patterns align in people who form lifelong, deeply connected bonds.

Now, we need your support to take this from theory to reality. With funding, we can conduct large-scale trials to validate our findings and develop a revolutionary matchmaking technology—one that goes beyond algorithms and psychology to the very essence of human connection. This isn't just about romance; it’s about transforming relationships, well-being, and even mental health on a global scale.

Join us in redefining love with science. Be a pioneer in funding the future of human connection!
