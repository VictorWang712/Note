## Understanding Postgraduate Studies

**Postgraduate studies** refer to any university course undertaken after completing an undergraduate degree. These programmes are typically more specialised and may involve either taught modules or guided research.

- Taught Masters (MA/MSc): A programme comprising taught modules, assessed through a combination of examinations and a short dissertation, typically completed within *12 months*.
- Research Masters (MPhil, MLitt): A focused research project culminating in a thesis of 20,000 to 30,000 words, typically completed within *12 to 24 months*.
- Doctoral Research (PhD, DPhil, or JD): An extended research project resulting in a thesis of 80,000 to 120,000 words, typically completed within *3 to 6 years*.
- Vocational Graduate Qualifications (e.g., ACAEW, SQE, BPTC): Professional qualifications that specialise in fields such as accountancy or law, typically involving *12 months of study and 18 months of vocational training*.

## The Postgraduate Application Process

What are the key components of a postgraduate application?

- Personal Statement or Statement of Purpose
- 2 or 3 Letters of Recommendation
- Language Tests
- Writing Sample
- Research or Dissertation Proposal

### Personal Statement or Statement of Purpose

**Personal Statement**: A document that outlines your suitability for the course, highlighting your academic background, relevant experiences, and motivations for choosing the university, programme, and field of study.

**Statement of Purpose**: A document that describes your proposed course of study, your academic and professional goals, and the factors motivating your application.

### Letters of Recommendation

**Letter of Recommendation**: A confidential letter from a third party, typically an academic or professional referee, that attests to your suitability for the course. It is crucial that the referee knows you well and can provide a detailed assessment of your abilities.

### Language Tests

**IELTS** and **TOEFL** are standardised tests that assess academic English proficiency and are widely accepted by universities. Both tests evaluate reading, writing, listening, and speaking skills.

The required IELTS score typically ranges from 6.5 to 7.

### Writing Sample

Some programmes require a writing sample, typically between 1,000 and 1,500 words, written in the language of instruction. This component assesses your ability to write effectively in an academic context.

### Research or Dissertation Proposal

Applicants for research-based programmes are typically required to submit a research proposal outlining their intended project. For non-research courses, a dissertation proposal may still be requested.

### Common Pitfalls in Postgraduate Applications

- Applications lack specificity and fail to highlight unique qualifications.
- Applications do not effectively demonstrate the applicant's potential.
- Applicants fail to address the specific prompts or requirements of the application.

> Example of a Weak Personal Statement
>
> My undergraduate degree sparked my interest in marketing. As a student in Culture, Media, and Creative industries, I have been exposed to various creative industries such as film and music industries. Marketing plays a significant role in the distribution and success of a product in these industries. While brands must still work to persuade a consumer to engage with a product, they must also cultivate an image of inclusivity and diversity across a range of industries, brands must be both eye-catching and inclusive. This rapidly expanding and competitive area of marketing has inspired me to learn more about how to incorporate social values in brand image.
>
> My undergraduate studies have exposed me to some of the underlying thinking and skills required in marketing and has given me the confidence to pursue marketing studies further. Intersectionality, which I learnt about in the *Diversity Matter's* module, allowed me to recognize the various inequalities that the creative industries face today. This, in turn, has led me to explore more deeply the inequalities and microaggressions still present in the marketing industry, such as target audiences' false gender assumption and the under- and misrepresentation of minority groups. As I look to the future, I hope to be a part of efforts to create marketing campaigns that reflect social values of diversity and inclusion.

Weaknesses of the Example:

- The introduction lacks originality and fails to capture attention.
- The first paragraph contains redundant information.
- The discussion of the *Diversity Matters* module is superficial and lacks depth
- The statement fails to highlight the applicant's unique potential or achievements
